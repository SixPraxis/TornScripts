### Torn Arrest Helper
Adds a filter button to the hospital page that will only show players that are hospitalized due to a safe crime. These players are more likely to have been out of jail for extended amounts of time, therefore being more likely to meet the arrest threshold. The script also adds a button to quickly go to the player's Times Jailed graph, which lets you see the last time they were arrested.
